'''Description:''' Library that can read and write QIF files.

==Notes==

This library is currently a <abbr title="work in progress">WIP</abbr>, 
with integration testing yet be done, but 
<strong>should</strong> work on any platform that can compile Swift.

This project was created with the aim to be able to allow users 
to import QIF files into 
<a href="https://github.com/bryceac/BCheckbook">BCheckbook</a>, 
so that data can be migrated easily.

===Limits===

Due to how I am processing the files, which utilizes Regex, 
this library does not support multiple sections, 
as it will only recognize the first <strong>!Type:</strong> instance.

It may be possible to support multiple sections with what I have, 
but I am not certain that it will work, 
nor do I intend to support multiple sections right now.

Another limitation of this library is that 
it supports only noninvestment transactions and does not support splits.

This is also by design, 
as the Invoice section is not typical found in QIF files, 
according to the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicken_Interchange_Format">QIF page</a> 
on Wikipedia, and many fields become complicated when including other items.
