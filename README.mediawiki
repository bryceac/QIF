'''Description:''' Library that can read and write QIF files.

==Notes==

This project was created with the aim to be able to allow users 
to import QIF files into 
<a href="https://github.com/bryceac/BCheckbook">BCheckbook</a>, 
so that data can be migrated easily.

===Limits===

At this time, only one section is supported, which can only be a noninvestment type.

This is by design, 
as this library is mainly meant 
for importing QIF files 
into an application that supports only one account and 
only deals with simple logging, 
though it is possible to produce QIF files using this library too.

Not only are only nonivestment sections supported, 
but splits are not supported either.

While the Quicken Interchange format supports splits, 
the program this library is meant for does not, so it has been left out.

If I see a need to support splits in the future, I might add it, 
but they are not a priority.
